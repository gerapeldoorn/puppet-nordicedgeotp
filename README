nordicedgeotp

This module installs the NordicEdge (now McAfee) OTPServer using the provided installer.

It is tested on RedHat only, but it should be quite easy to adapt it for use with Debian (or something else). Pull requests are welcome.

You do need to add your own configfile, an empty placeholder is there.
